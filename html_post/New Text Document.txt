I wanted to write some code that would POST a bunch of analog variables to my webserver.  I couldn't find a great POST example, so I muddled through it for a couple hours.  My code is working, so I'm posting it as a reference to anyone in the same spot.  

This example builds and sends a POST request to my server every .5 seconds.  It doesn't bother to look at the response, just barfs data into the server like there's no tomorrow.  I get the sense that not all my requests make it to the server, because the timestamps of my data in the server aren't evenly spaced.  Still!  It's data, going up!

I'm using a wifly shield, but this should work for anyone using the httpclient or Ethernet libraries.


Something I didn't know before writing this--POST parameters are serialized just like GET parameters, and they're just listed in the "content" part of the HTTP request.  For example, if you want to POST the parameters "larry"=5, "curly"=6, "moe"=7, your POST content just looks like

larry=5&curly=6&moe=7

how cool is that?

Hope this helps somebody out.  Happy Hacking!
